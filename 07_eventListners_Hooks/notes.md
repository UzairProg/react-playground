Hooks are special React functions that let functional components use state, lifecycle, and context features without writing class components.​

Major Types of Hooks (Crisp Summary)
1. useState – Manages state in a functional component (store and update values).
2. useEffect – Handles side effects like API calls, timers, or DOM updates.
3. useContext – Accesses global context data without passing props manually.
4. useRef – Creates a reference to DOM elements or stores mutable values.
5. useReducer – Manages complex state logic using reducers (alternative to useState).
6. useMemo – Memoizes values, improving performance by caching results.
7. useCallback – Memoizes functions, preventing unnecessary re-creations.
8. useLayoutEffect – Runs synchronously after DOM mutations (before painting).
9. useImperativeHandle – Customizes what gets exposed by a ref to parent components.
10. Custom Hooks – Your own hooks combining logic or reusing stateful features across components.​

In short:
Hooks = functions that give function components power to manage state, effects, and logic just like class components—but in a cleaner, reusable way.
