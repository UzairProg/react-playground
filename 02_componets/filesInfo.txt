components/
Contains all React components (UI building blocks).

Organize by feature or type for scalability (e.g., Button/, Header/, TodoList/).

Each component folder can include .js/.jsx, .css or .module.css, and tests files.


public/
Holds static files served directly without processing (HTML template, favicon, manifest, robots.txt).

Assets placed here are referenced by absolute paths, e.g., /logo.png in index.html or <img src="/logo.png" />.

Not imported into JS, just copied as-is at build time.

assets/ (usually inside src/)
Stores images, fonts, icons, and other media imported within React components.

Vite or build tool optimizes and hashes these files for caching.

Imported using relative paths in JS: import logo from './assets/logo.png'.
